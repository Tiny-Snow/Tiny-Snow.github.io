This course is designed to provide foundational knowledge and skills in the field of computer graphics (CG). This course, mainly based on the [GAMES101](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html) course by [Prof. Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/) at UC Santa Barbara, covers a broad range of topics essential for anyone interested in CG, including mathematical foundations in CG, transformation, rasterization, shading, ray tracing, texture mapping, and other advanced topics.
