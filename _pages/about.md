I am a Master student in [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jiawei Chen](https://jiawei-chen.github.io/).

I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Prof. Ranran Huang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/huangranran/zh_CN/index/622945/list/index.htm) on Bioinformatics.

I have published multiple papers in top machine learning conferences, including NeurIPS, KDD, etc. I have also served as a reviewer for conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, etc. Recently, I have been focusing on research in **Recommender Systems**, epsecially in **Recommendation Loss** and **Generative Recommender Systems**. My other research interests include **Reinforcement Learning** and **Large Language Models**.
