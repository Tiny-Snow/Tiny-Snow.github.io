I am a Master student in [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Jiawei Chen](https://jiawei-chen.github.io/). In my previous studies, I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Ranran Huang](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/huangranran/zh_CN/index/622945/list/index.htm). I have published multiple papers in top-tier machine learning conferences, such as NeurIPS, KDD, WWW, etc. I have also served as a reviewer for conferences including NeurIPS, ICLR, SIGIR, etc.

During my M.S. studies, I focused on multiple research topics in the field of recommender systems optimization, including ranking metrics optimization (e.g., [PSL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00163), [SL@K](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05673), [Talos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19276)), LLM-based recommendation (e.g., [BEAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22925)), and scaling laws of large recommendation models (e.g., SPRINT), with a ultimate goal of achieving mathematical-principled foundation models. My other research interests include reinforcement learning, agent, and long-context LLMs.
